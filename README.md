## Messenger Analyse

The goal of this simple package is to help you better understand your Facebook Messenger data. It reads in your Messenger data locally and produces a `html` file, allowing you to explore your data.

To see what the analysis file will look like, see [here](https://github.com/aoshenz/messenger_analyse/blob/master/example/output_example.html) for an example. Below are some snippets from this file.

</div>

## How to set up

1. Go to your Facebook [settings](https://www.facebook.com/dyi/?referrer=yfi_settings) > 'Your Facebook Information' > 'Download Your Information' and at a minimum you need to choose these options:
    - File optins in JSON format
    - All time date range
    - Check the boxes for 'Messages', 'Profile information' and 'Friends and followers'

    It takes up to a few days for Facebook to gather this information before you can download it.

</div>


2. Meanwhile, clone this repository.
`Insert instructions here`
3. Within 'messenger_analyse', create a folder called 'personal_data'. Your Facebook data should be in a `.zip` file. Unzip that file here. So your folder structure should look like: 
messenger_analyse (this repo) > personal_data (folder you created) > facebook-your_name (unzipped facebook folders).
4. Create a virtual environment and install packages from `requirements.txt`.


## How to use

### Run from terminal
```zsh
(venv) âžœ  messenger_analyse git:(master) python3 main.py
```

### Run from notebook
The `Messenger` class contains methods and attributes allowing you to do further exploration. The code below is an example of some useful attributes to help you get started.
```python
from messenger import Messenger

msg = Messenger()
msg.analyse()

# Data
msg.data_all # data before adjustments
msg.data_adj # data after adjustments i.e. date filter, some flags

# Metrics
